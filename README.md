# SteamConfigtoDropbox
Simple powershell script to backup userdata and create a shared profile for all steam profiles on a computer, stored in dropbox.

Run the script without any parameters (./Create-ConfigLink.ps1). Just run it, and it will automatically connect all your steam accounts to a shared config folder in your dropbox.
